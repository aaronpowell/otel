<!--
PROMPT for GPT-4:
Write me a README.md for package vercel/otel that helps people get started by setting up their exporter and trace provider for them and false bundles all OPen Telemetry apis in a single package.
It's not a powerful as using raw APIS, but It should be enough for most cases.

This package exports function `register()` that registers open telemetry provider with a HTTP exporter.
Register function takes one argument, it's string and it's a service name. It will be used as the app name in many OpenTelemetry backends.
This package also reexports `@opentelemetry/api` and `@opentelemetry/semantics`.

Use that hip style for Readme that many JS devs use. Keep it concise.

```

## ðŸ“– API Reference

### `register(serviceName: string)`

Registers the OpenTelemetry provider with an HTTP exporter using the given service name.
This is all that is needed to trace your app on Vercel.

- `serviceName`: The name of your service, used as the app name in many OpenTelemetry backends.

### Re-exported APIs

This package re-exports everything from `@opentelemetry/api`. Refer to the official [OpenTelemetry API documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/) for details on how to use these APIs.

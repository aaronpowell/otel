<!--
PROMPT for GPT-4:
Write me a README.md for package vercel/otel that helps people get started by setting up their exporter and trace provider for them and false bundles all OPen Telemetry apis in a single package.
It's not a powerful as using raw APIS, but It should be enough for most cases.

This package exports function `register()` that registers open telemetry provider with a HTTP exporter.
Register function takes one argument, it's string and it's a service name. It will be used as the app name in many OpenTelemetry backends.
This package also reexports `@opentelemetry/api` and `@opentelemetry/semantics`.

Use that hip style for Readme that many JS devs use. Keep it concise.

# ðŸš€ Vercel Otel

`vercel/otel` is a simple and easy-to-use package that sets up your trace provider and exporter, and bundles all OpenTelemetry APIs in a single package. It's not as powerful as using raw APIs, but it should be enough for most cases.

ðŸ’¡ Use this package to quickly instrument your applications and get started with OpenTelemetry!

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```sh
npm install vercel/otel
```

## ðŸ“š Usage

```javascript
const { register, trace } = require("vercel/otel");

// Register the OpenTelemetry provider with an HTTP exporter
register("your-service-name");

// Now you can use the OpenTelemetry APIs
const span = trace.getTracer("your-component").startSpan("your-operation");
```

### ðŸŽ¨ Customizing your setup

The `register` function takes a single string argument for your service name. This will be used as the app name in many OpenTelemetry backends.

The package also re-exports `@opentelemetry/api` and `@opentelemetry/semantics` for your convenience.

```javascript
const { context, trace, SemanticAttributes } = require("vercel/otel");

// Use the OpenTelemetry APIs and semantic attributes as needed
const span = trace.getTracer("your-component").startSpan("your-operation", {
  attributes: {
    [SemanticAttributes.HTTP_METHOD]: "GET",
  },
});

// Modify the context as needed
const ctx = trace.setSpan(context.active(), span);
```

## ðŸ“– API Reference

### `register(serviceName: string)`

Registers the OpenTelemetry provider with an HTTP exporter using the given service name.
This is all that is needed to trace your app on Vercel.

- `serviceName`: The name of your service, used as the app name in many OpenTelemetry backends.

### Re-exported APIs

This package re-exports the following APIs from `@opentelemetry/api` and `@opentelemetry/semantics`:

- `context`
- `trace`
- `SemanticAttributes`

Refer to the official [OpenTelemetry API documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/) for details on how to use these APIs.
